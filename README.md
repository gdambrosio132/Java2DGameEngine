# Java2DGameEngine

Powerful and Fluid 2D game engine made in Java

## How to download

1. Clone the respoitory, make sure you have JDK 8 or 11

2. Make sure you run this on an ideal IDE (Intellij recommended)

## How it works

1. Locate the source (src) file and create a new Java file which extends the Game abstract class

2. Create the initialized and update method.

3. Below is a sample code

```Java
public class sampleGame extends Game{
    
    //Delcare properties here
    
    public void initialize(){
        //Initialize properties here
    }
    public void update(){
        //Update properties overtime here
        //Called 60 times a second
    }
}
```

## Sample Games

Within the source file, there are already 4 sample games which are Starfish Collector, Asteroids, Plane Dodger, and Sub Survival. 
These games goes show the ability that this game engine can create. You can look at these files as reference when creating a game of your own.

### Starfish Collector
